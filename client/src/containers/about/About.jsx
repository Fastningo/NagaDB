            <p>
              NagaDB serves as a comprehensive repository created by Project
              NAGA速, a non-profit organization, encompassing all unclaimed
              veterans. Our primary goal is to document the legacies,
              achievements, and narratives of veterans spanning across
              generations, as a tribute to their enduring service and sacrifice.
              This open-source initiative seeks to unite communities, fostering
              collaboration towards the establishment of an easily accessible
              database housing unclaimed veterans' records.

              Project NAGA速, Inc. shall promote the use of technology for honoring
              Veterans and work toward the continued stewardship of the history of
              Veterans and his or her accomplishments. Furthermore, Project NAGA速,
              Inc. will work in partnership with private individuals,
              environmental and recreational organizations, and government
              agencies at local, county, state, and federal levels. Critically,
              Project NAGA速, Inc. shall work with other organizations toward the
              goal of ensuring all Veterans are buried with honor, recognition,
              and respect.

              As the saying goes, "A person dies twice; once when they take their
              final breath, and later, the last time their name is spoke." This
              sentiment rings particularly true for veterans. This platform stands
              as a testament to ensuring that their names endure in history,
              preserving their memory for generations to come.
